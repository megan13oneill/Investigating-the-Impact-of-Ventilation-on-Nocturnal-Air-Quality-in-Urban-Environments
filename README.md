#Investigating the Impact of Ventilation on Nocturnal Air Quality in Urban Environments
##About The Project
This project explores how indoor air quality during nocturnal hours changes with and without ventilation. The project monitors various environmental parameters at different locations within a room, providing insights into the dynamics of indoor air quality during sleep. The collected data uses key indoor air quality metrics such as Temperature / Â° C, Humidity / %, CO2 / ppm, VOC / ppm, Compensated Gas / ppm and IAQ which have been collected using the Nicla Sense ME BSEC sensor.
